What The FAQ???
================

Why is this project called Toris?
---------------------------------

Toris may be a recursive acronym for This Otter Rocks In Seamonkey. Maybe not. We're not really sure.

Why do you host your project on Github? It's not free like free speech.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, we already know that. But, hold on, in github, there's "Teub". If you don't speak French, don't even try to understand.

Why a BeerWare licence?
-----------------------

Buy us a beer. We'll explain to you. We're not sure it'll be cristal clear, but, let's give it a try.

Where the beer-root comes from?
-------------------------------

We worship beers.
We are mainly (not really in fact) sysadmin. So Root. That's all.
And, if you speak some French slang, you'll maybe understand the meaning of this.

Who are you?
------------

Woo hooo ! Yeah, The who !

Why go language? There are plenty of better languages like (insert your favorite language here)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because go no go. Some silly monkey story.

Where's the code? Show us the code!
-----------------------------------

Be patient Luke.

Hey ! I need credentials to access the website!
-----------------------------------------------

Do we know you? Who are you? What are you? Do you come in peace?

Your website is just a piece of crap!
-------------------------------------

Well. We're not really webdesigners. And we have some weird taste. You don't like it. Ok, you're free to go.

Your code is "dirty"!
---------------------

That's you're point of view. But, you can help us to improve it. We can refuse or accept your contribution. Beers help us to accept.

Can I contribute?
-----------------

First question: Do you love otters? Really?

Ok, now, buy us some beers. And we'll talk about this.

And, of course, if you're.... Ahem. Well, we can maybe do something for you.

I wanna be an otter!
--------------------

Spice girls are prohibited (unless you're one of them)

But, if you know the real meaning of otter, maybe you're already one! And if you wanna be one, just contact us!

I'm native English speaker and I don't understand your FAQ! Is this normal?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yup. We're French with some kind of deviant ethylic sense of humour. But, if you've read so far, you should consult some specialist of mental illness.
